# dashboard2
JS based feedback dashboard. Uses SSE to push events.

This is meant to integrate into a robotpy project to replace SmartDashboard. dashboard2 gives unlimited functionality at a high update rate, without any of problems of SmartDashboard.

To use, set up charts, choosers, and extensions in your robotInit, then call dashboard2.run(). Full documentation coming soon.
